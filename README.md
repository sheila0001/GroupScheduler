GroupScheduler

GroupScheduler is a Python tool I built to make it easier for groups to find free time together—whether it’s for meetings, hangouts, or team projects. It takes everyone’s busy schedules, figures out when you’re all available, and spits out readable time slots like "08:00 - 10:00".

What It Does

Handles schedules for multiple people, calculates conflicts, and finds free time in a single day.

Converts time ranges like 08:00-10:00 into minute-based intervals for precise calculations.

Outputs free time slots in a clean, readable format.

What I Used

Python: Dataclasses, custom classes (TimeRange, CustomList), and helper functions to manage and format schedules.

A simple command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the tool.

Future Plans

Add features to export schedules to files like JSON or CSV.

Maybe build a GUI or web version to make it even more user-friendly.

Integrate with Google Calendar or similar tools.

How to Use

Clone the repo.

Run main.py to enter schedules and see when everyone’s free.

That’s it—simple and effective!
